## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed.
- Scrapy installed (`pip install scrapy`).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed if you plan to clone the repository.
- MySQL database set up with the correct credentials (as defined in `pipelines.py`) if you want to use the `SaveToMySQLPipeline`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-scrapy-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-scrapy-project
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Scrapy spider and start scraping data from "books.toscrape.com," follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory if you're not already there:

   ```bash
   cd your-scrapy-project
   ```

2. Run the Scrapy spider:

   ```bash
   scrapy crawl bookspider
   ```

The scraped data will be saved to a JSON file (`booksdata.json` by default) in the project's root directory. If you want to save data to a MySQL database, ensure you have set up the database and provided the correct credentials in `pipelines.py`.

- `your_scrapy_project/`: The main project directory.
  - `your_scrapy_project/`
    - `spiders/`: Contains Scrapy spider(s) for scraping.
